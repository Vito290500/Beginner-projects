It's a simple aritmhetic formatter with error handling.
I know is not the best code and i'm working in simplify the code but first i have to learn more and practive a lot. 
The exercise is the first of "freeCodeCamp" site and "Scientific Computing with Python Projects" course.
I have add the option to solve 1 to 4 problems,and not only 4; i add the option to solve the problem give with one input and the error handling of the "space".
